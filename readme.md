I apologize that I attached built files to git instead of source code in a hurry. The code attached now should work after following below steps.

            ***Instructions to run the code
a. Ensure the environment running this code has node.js installed globally.

b. When you download ensure that you have set write permission on the src folder and its subdirectories. Navigate till src folder and then execute below commands.

c. navigate to src directory and run "npm i" command from visual studio code terminal.

d. Once npm installed successfully, run "ng serve -open" to compile and open the angular app in the browser.

All the scope items are implemented except the below requirement Page refresh should maintain the sorting and search related data.
